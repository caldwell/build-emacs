# This launcher code is from emacsformacosx.com and is not part of Emacs
# proper. It exists so that there can be a single download that contains
# binaries for all supported Mac OS X versions.
#
# Why not just use a fat binary? Because fat binaries can only hold 1 of
# each architecture and Emacs has multiple x86_64 architectures binaries.
#
# Why are there multiple x86_64 binaries? Because the Emacs source does OS
# feature detection at compile time instead of at run-time. So If you build
# Emacs on 10.9 then it will contain hard-coded calls to 10.9 APIs and will
# not run on 10.6. If you compile it on 10.6, then it will also run on 10.9,
# but it won't take advantage of any of the features in 10.9.
